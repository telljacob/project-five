# ML Business Case

## Dataset Content
* The dataset is sources from [Kaggle](https://www.Kaggle.com). The dataset was found from a different user but I will apply it to this ficticious case.
* The dataset contains 27 167 images in total, 17 678 of them are photos of male faces and 9 489 are of female faces. 

## Business Requirements
* The business requirement is 


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
1. 
* 

2.
* 

3. 
* 


## Rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized a ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course
* 


## Dashboard Design
* Summary page, to give an overview of the entire project, presenting the business requirements and how the application shows it.
* Problemsolvning techniques, grasping the idea behind the project and bringing displaying the information clearly.
* Hypothesis, showing the questions the project intends to answer and how they are validated.
* ML Pipeline, to describe how the project pipeline works.



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly in case all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide example(s) on how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
